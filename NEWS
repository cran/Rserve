 NEWS/Changelog for Rserve
---------------------------

0.4-6	2006-11-30
    o	fixed bug in RSeval when handling large objects

    o	minor fix in RSassign

    o	add an endianness hack for Windows in case config.h is not
	included properly


0.4-5	2006-11-29
    o	added --with-server option (by default enabled). When disabled,
	the server itself is not built. When enabled, R must provide R
	shared library, i.e. it must have been compiled with
	--enable-R-shlib.

    o	added --with-client option (by default disabled). When
	enabled, the C/C++ client is built and installed in the
	package. It will be copied in the "client" directory of the
	package and contains all files necessary for building a
	client application.

	This option has no effect on the R client which is always
	built and installed.

    o	Windows version of Rserve now builds and installs both debug
	(Rserve_d.exe) and regular (Rserve.exe) version of Rserve. In
	addition, the Rserve function can now be used to launch Rserve
	even on Windows.

    o	endianness detection now prefers information from the compiler
	macros thus allowing cross-compilation. Use -D_BIG_ENDIAN_ or
	-D_LITTLE_ENDIAN_ to override it if necessary.

    o	allows universal build on Mac OS X

    o	adapt to R_ParseVector interface change in R-devel


0.4-4	2006-11-15
    o	first release on CRAN

    o	added support for RAW type (both in and out)

    o	added rudimentary client support (thanks to David Reiss for
	his contributions) and documentation
