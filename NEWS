 NEWS/Changelog for Rserve
---------------------------

0.5-2	2008-10-17
    o	fix a bug in CMD_readFile and CMD_setBufferSize that
	resulted in invalid buffer sizes (one of the ways to
	trigger the bug was to attempt to read a small number of
	bytes with readFile). Thanks to H. Rehauer for reporting.

    o	ignore attributes if they are not in a LISTSXP - there seem
	to be other uses of the ATTRIB entry in conjunction with
	character hashes in recent R versions. (BR #76)

    o	adapt C++ client to changes in 0.5 (at least to the point
	where the demo1 code works)

    o	add support for XT_VECTOR_EXP in assignments

    o	improve protection for vectors

    o	report "remote" setting in --RS-settings

    o	updates in the REngine Java client, added documentation

0.5-1	2008-07-22
    o	fix build issue with R 2.7.x on Windows

    o	mergefat now works properly and uses cp if there is no lipo
	(this fixes multi-arch issues on Mac OS X and makes sure that
	Rserve/Rserve.dbg are installed even on non-Mac systems)

0.5-0	2008-07-21
    o	added CMD_serEval and CMD_serAssign which are highly efficient
	when talking to R clients as they don't need any intermediate
	buffer. The corresponding R client functions RSeval and
	RSassign have been re-written to use this new API.

    o	deprecate scalar types in the protocol

    o	add more efficient storage for dotted-pair lists
	and symbol names

    o	add support for complex numbers

    o	new Java client: REngine
	it is more flexible than JRclient and it can be used with
	other Java/R engines such as JRI. Also it has a much more
	clean API and better exeption handling.
	- allow NaNs to be passed in raw form to R, i.e. double
	  NAs can be created using
	  Double.longBitsToDouble(0x7ff00000000007a2L)
	  (nice methods for this should follow)

    o	C++ client was moved to src/client/cxx

JRclient:
    o	change the representation of lists to generic
	named vectors (class RList)

    o	change the ways attributes are accessed

0.4-7	2007-01-14
    o	relax DLL versions checking on Windows

    o	added more sophisticated implementation of RSassign
	in R client to support larger data. Nevertheless, due to
	limitations in R, objects must be serializable to
	less than 8MB to be assignable via RSassign.

    o	added more robust error handling in the R client

    o	fixed compilation on systems with custom include dir
	(such as Debian)

    o	JRclient is now part of the Rserve package.
	See clients.txt for details.
	It is not compiled by default (but installed when
	--with-client is specified), because we cannot assume the
	existence of a Java compiler.


0.4-6	2006-11-30
    o	fixed bug in RSeval when handling large objects

    o	minor fix in RSassign

    o	add an endianness hack for Windows in case config.h is not
	included properly


0.4-5	2006-11-29
    o	added --with-server option (by default enabled). When disabled,
	the server itself is not built. When enabled, R must provide R
	shared library, i.e. it must have been compiled with
	--enable-R-shlib.

    o	added --with-client option (by default disabled). When
	enabled, the C/C++ client is built and installed in the
	package. It will be copied in the "client" directory of the
	package and contains all files necessary for building a
	client application.

	This option has no effect on the R client which is always
	built and installed.

    o	Windows version of Rserve now builds and installs both debug
	(Rserve_d.exe) and regular (Rserve.exe) version of Rserve. In
	addition, the Rserve function can now be used to launch Rserve
	even on Windows.

    o	endianness detection now prefers information from the compiler
	macros thus allowing cross-compilation. Use -D_BIG_ENDIAN_ or
	-D_LITTLE_ENDIAN_ to override it if necessary.

    o	allows universal build on Mac OS X

    o	adapt to R_ParseVector interface change in R-devel


0.4-4	2006-11-15
    o	first release on CRAN

    o	added support for RAW type (both in and out)

    o	added rudimentary client support (thanks to David Reiss for
	his contributions) and documentation
